Data and Content Analysis for FYP

I've been gathering and analyzing extensive data from a wide range of content, looking at metrics like likes, comments, shares, and watch time, as well as visual and audio features. The main goal is to identify the consistent patterns and trends in viral content, including music choices, hashtags (#), video duration, and even visual styles, to discover the key factors that contribute to the highest FYP success rate.

Machine Learning Model Development

In addition to the analysis, I'm also building a machine learning model that is trained to predict which types of content will be successful on the FYP. This model uses advanced algorithms to process and understand the complex relationships between various content elements (like combinations of hashtags, sounds, and video types) and their performance on the platform. This allows the model to provide accurate predictions on the optimal content characteristics for achieving maximum visibility on TikTok.
